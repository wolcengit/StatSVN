Quick Example
===================

the statsvn.bat file is a quick example of how to create a statsvn report.

It generates the xdoc in site/statsvn but it could equally do it in 
target/generated-xdocs except that this directory could be cleared
by "maven clean", so it is put in a src directory but not checked in.
