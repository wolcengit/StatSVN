The StatSVN Team and Appendium are proud to announce v0.7.0 of StatSVN

If you want to know what happened in your Subversion repository,
this is the tool for you!

StatSVN retrieves information from a Subversion repository and generates
various tables and charts describing the project evolution, e.g.
the lines of code over time, contribution of each developer, the
evolution of modules, directories, files, the time and days when most
checkins happen, etc. It also shows the commit logs and integrates 
out of the box with ViewVc, BugZilla, Chora and others.

StatSVN generates a static suite of HTML or XDoc documents containing 
tables and chart images.


New Features: 

** Inspired by StatCVS-xml, A module mechanism is added to StatCVS whereby it is now possible to define
   some regular expression to group files into modules and have a dedicated set of statistics per module
** 2 new command line options: headerUrl and footerUrl the content of which will 
   be incorporated just after opening body or just before the end of body.

*  Upgrade to StatCVS 0.7.0   
*  Using Bit.ly instead of tr.im
*  The latest commit page will always be called commitlog.html Thanks to David Multer

* fix 	Fixing NPE issue and bad link when there are no commits in a repository. Thanks to David Multer

StatSVN is open source software, released under the terms of the LGPL,
based on StatCVS, it uses JFreeChart and JTreeMap to generate charts.
